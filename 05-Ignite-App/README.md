```React.createElement(element want to create, {}, children)```

 `details` : 
 1:- React.createElement("h1", {id: "parent"}, "Hello react") <br>
        
 2:- for creating nesting structure ```Use Parent To create another React Element ```



Till now, what ever code is write is not production ready.
to make production ready code these had many steps:
1) compress the all static files
2) minified all the code
3) many more

To make production ready app, we many more package to make it production ready
React alone is not enoght. we need some other library to make our app, scalable, production ready.

We need NPM to download all the pakages

NPM is not a NODE Package manager.
NPM is not stand as Node Package Manager.
NPM does not have a any full form.
NPM work is it manages the pacakages.

First Thing to do:- All NPM to our Project
